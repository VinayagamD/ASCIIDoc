== Introduction
AsciiDoc is  _also_ plain test! IT's as readable as Markdown, but has more features.

== Advantages
* #Single specification#
* Designed to be converted to multiple formats
** HTML
** ((PDF))
** ((DocBook))
** man page
** ((EPUB))
** more...
* *Many* more (optional) features than Markdown.
* Can be used to write books (Supported by ((O'Reilly)))
* Corporate sponsorship by ((Okta))

== Disadvantage
* Less well-known

== Text Formatting
Of course, ((italics)) and ((bold)) are supported. However, AsciiDoc also include des ((underlining)), ((strikethrough)) and ((highlighting)).

* _italics_
* *bold*
* #highlighting#
* [.underline]#underline#
* [.line-through]#strikethrough#

=== More Visual Formatting
Check out this ((note))!

NOTE: You can even high##light## or italicize _parts_ of words!

In addition to `NOTE`, there are other options:

TIP: Look both the ways before crossing the streets.

WARNING: Don't answer the phone if you don't recognize the number

CAUTION: Wet floor.

IMPORTANT: Wash your hands!

=== Superscript/Subscript
Creating a ((superscript)) or ((subscript)) is as easy as bold or italics.

* e = mc^2^
* Drink lots of H~2~O
* 2^8^ = 256

== Including Files
With AsciiDoc, you can ((include)) external files. This means that you cna re-use files (headers, footers, signatures, disclaimers, etc.), or keep your documentation more organized. For example, have a separate file for every chapter of a book.

include::Including.adoc[]

Now, the text above comes from a separate file.


== Including code
Code files can be included as well -- and so can their output!

This is especially useful for validating that ((code samples)) actually work.

.count.py
[source,py]
----
include::count.py[]
----

*Output*

----
include::out.txt[]
----


== Tables
Tables are similar to Markdown

.Character Ages
|===
| Name | Age | Hobbies

| Fred
| 33
| Bird Watching

| Barney
| 31
| Bowling

|===

*But wait -- there's more!*

You can create tables out of _CSV files_!
[%header, format=csv]
|===
include::data.csv[]
|===

This means that each time a document is generated, it can have _fresh_ data.

== Sidebars
sidebar:

[sidebar]
****
Use sidebars to visually complementary information from the main text
****

.Another Sidebar
****
This demonstrates some additional functionality of the sidebar.

TIP: Sidebars can contain any type of content.
